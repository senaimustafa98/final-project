## **Getting Started**

### Clone the Repository
Clone the main branch of this repository to your local machine and navigate into the cloned project folder.
### Install dependencies using pnpm

Open a CLI in the project folder and run:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Start database

Setup the database as mentioned below. To start the database run:

```bash
postgres
```

### Populate database

The database is populated with migrations (using the ley library, which is a dependency of this project). Run the following command to populate the database:

```bash
pnpm migrate up
```
### Run local development server

You can start the development server for the project by running the following command:

```bash
pnpm start
```

This will open the Expo Developer Tools in your browser. From there, you can:

- Scan the QR code using the Expo Go app on your phone to run the app on your physical device.
- Run the app on an Android or iOS emulator/simulator (if set up on your machine).


## Database Setup

If you don't have PostgreSQL installed yet, follow the instructions from the PostgreSQL step in [UpLeveled's System Setup Instructions](https://github.com/upleveled/system-setup/blob/master/readme.md).

Copy the `.env.example` file to a new file called `.env` (ignored from Git) and fill in the necessary information.

Then, connect to the built-in `postgres` database as administrator in order to create the database:

### Windows

If it asks for a password, use `postgres`.

```bash
psql -U postgres
```

### macOS

```bash
psql postgres
```

### Linux

```bash
sudo -u postgres psql
```


Once you have connected to PostgreSQL, run the following to create the database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE workout_tracker;
CREATE USER workoutapp WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'workoutapp';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE workout_tracker TO workoutapp;
\connect workout_tracker
```

If you need to create tables at this stage, you can use the following commands:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR(80) NOT NULL,
  password_hash VARCHAR(80) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  UNIQUE (username)
);

CREATE TABLE exercises (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  workout_id INT REFERENCES workouts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  set_number INT NOT NULL,
  reps INT NOT NULL,
  weight INT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE workouts (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  duration VARCHAR(50),
  user_id INT REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE sessions (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  token VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  expiry_timestamp TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT (now() + INTERVAL '24 hours'),
  user_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE migrations (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);
```















Quit `psql` using the following command:

```bash
\q
```

On Linux, it is [best practice to create an operating system user for each database](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/configuring_and_using_database_servers/using-postgresql_configuring-and-using-database-servers#con_postgresql-users_using-postgresql), to ensure that the operating system user can only access the single database and no other system resources. A different password is needed on Linux because [passwords of operating system users cannot contain the user name](https://github.com/upleveled/system-setup/issues/74). First, generate a random password and copy it:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 16
```

Then create the user, using the database user name from the previous section above. When you are prompted to create a password for the user, paste in the generated password.

```bash
sudo adduser <user name>
```

Once you're ready to use the new user, reconnect using the following command.

**Windows and macOS:**

```bash
psql -U <user name> <database name>
```

**Linux:**

```bash
sudo -u <user name> psql -U <user name> <database name>
```
